Comprehensive Data Analytics Projects: Power BI Dashboard and Predictive Modeling for IIT/NIT Admissions & Sales analytics

Overview :
This repository showcases three significant projects that leverage data analytics to provide insights into IIT and NIT admissions trends over the past five years. Each project is designed to facilitate data-driven decision-making and enhance understanding of competitive landscapes.

# 1. Power BI Dashboard for IIT/NIT Cutoff Ranks
Description: An advanced Power BI dashboard visualizing cutoff rank trends for IITs and NITs, offering a critical tool for stakeholders in the admissions process.

Key Insights:
- Category-wise Analysis: Examine variations in opening and closing ranks across categories, highlighting the competitive 
  environment and the impact of reservation policies.
- Institute-wise Comparisons: Analyze demand across IITs and NITs, identifying institutions with consistently lower cutoff 
  ranks, thus revealing student preferences and institutional appeal.
- Round-wise Trends: Explore how ranks fluctuate across different seat allocation rounds, providing a comprehensive view of 
  the admissions dynamics over time.
  
Notable Features:
- Interactive filters and slicers enable users to tailor analyses to specific categories or institutes.
  Essential metrics, including highest opening rank, average closing rank, and yearly changes, are prominently displayed 
  for immediate insight.

# 2. Data Science Project for Predictive Analytics

Description: A state-of-the-art project employing statistical modeling and machine learning to predict future cutoff ranks for IITs and NITs based on historical data.
- Innovative Techniques: Utilizes advanced algorithms to generate forecasts, allowing stakeholders to anticipate trends and 
  make informed strategic decisions.
- Visual Impact: Compelling visualizations present complex predictive insights in an easily digestible format, enhancing 
  stakeholder engagement.
  
# 3. Sample Sales Dashboard
Description: A practical dashboard designed to demonstrate my data visualization skills in a business context, highlighting the ability to translate data into actionable business intelligence.
- Insightful Metrics: Showcases key sales metrics and performance indicators, providing a clear overview of sales trends 
  that support strategic business decisions.
